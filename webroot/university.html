                In all honsety my current university projects are not noteworthy as I'm new to coding and due to my own shortcomings I was unable to do many projects
                i.e. both programming mini-projects. That being said the project I take the most pride in has to be this one designing a website with incomplete functi
                -onalitites which I do intend to fix. However, some of my other noteworthy projects from University so far come in PRP which can be found <a href="PRP.pdf">here</a>

            Ultimately this year has been a learning experience for me, coming into university underprepared and overwhelmed for the most part I now know what to expect for the next
            academic year. I also intend to get prepared for most of next years modules in the summer to ensure I don't come in how I did this year clueless, and always finding
            myself falling behind. This year has been a massive learning curve coming into Computer Science from previous Humanities experience, however I wouldn't change it
            for anything else and after getting through this year I'm ready and preparing myself for the challenge!
