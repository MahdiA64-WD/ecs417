             My name's Mohammed Mahdi Ahmed, I'm a student of Computer Science Bsc in Queen Mary University. I'm a young aspiring Software
             Engineer, whilst this is undetermined I'm planning to see where my course ventures me to and intend to find my specialist field by the end of my second year!
             Outside of University I thoroughly enjoy watching sports especially Football as an avid United Fan! I also love watching anime and films some of
             which can be found <a href="Exercise2_Topic4.html">here!</a> I also love travelling and getting out my comfort zone when I can and certainly wish to do more
             of this when possible!
