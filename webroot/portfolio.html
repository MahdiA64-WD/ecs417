                During 2 weeks in year 10 I done work experience in an Estate Agency. In that time I was prompted to take on tasks such as interacting
                with customers in terms of viewing a property etc. I learnt basic admin skills in regards to being an estate agent such as listing properties
                on sites such as Zoopla, also roles within the building the estate agency operates in.

            Charity work: alongside my Uncle I help with creating charity events (pre-covid) such as Football Tournaments in Power League which would raise money
            for different crisis's or causes that need urgent support some of which included raising money for Yemen, raising money for Syrian Refugees etc.
            Helping set up these events and being involved in the behind the scenes work of it helped me get a better understanding of the logistics and time needed
            to set up etc, which will help me in the future as I to intend to host charitable events which make for a good time whilst raising money for a good cause.
