               I live in East London one noteable thing about my hometown is it's diversity, there are many different races accepted and located
        around my area. </em>
    </p>
    <br>
     <p>
         <em class="p1">
         Another aspect of the area I live in  is that's it close to the Exchange Mall located in Ilford making shopping easy and accessible. </em>
     </p>
     <br>
     <p>
         <em class="p1">
        Thirdly, in my area there are a lot of places to get food from despite there not being many options to get healthy foods. </em>

         <em class="p2">
        One feature of my village back home is that it's very naturistic and has a decently sized pond out the front. </em>
     </p>
     <br>
     <p>
         <em class="p2">
         Another feature of my village back home is that it's very isolated as there's more space in the area the house is standoffish for a few yards from neighbouring
         houses. </em>
     </p>
     <br>
     <p>
         <em class="p2">
         Finally my house back home houses two of my cousins family also right next to it whilst my grandma and uncle's family reside in the home. </em>
